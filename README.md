**DrugCombinationPrediction_DRS** 

--

**DrugCombinationPrediction_DRS**is a computational framework that enhances the prediction of synergistic drug combinations in oncology by leveraging **signature-based gene expression features**.
Specifically, it introduces **Drug Resistance Signatures (DRS)**â€”gene expression patterns derived from resistant and sensitive cell linesâ€”as novel features for machine learning and deep learning models. This framework demonstrates superior predictive performance and biological interpretability compared to conventional drug representations. It has been evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets (DrugComb, ALMANAC, Oâ€™Neil, AstraZeneca-Sanger) and includes a custom deep learning model named **SynergyX** designed for robust generalization and cross dataset validation. The goal is to provide biologically meaningful and computationally effective tools for drug synergy prediction, supporting precision medicine in cancer treatment.
